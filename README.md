Learning [from the masters] to write interpreters in Golang.

## Introduction
I am learning to write interpreters in Golang. 
I found parsing the **boogie** [programming language](https://github.com/TheApeMachine/boogie) 
from [Daniel Owen van Dommelen](https://github.com/TheApeMachine) very insightful.

I am following the steps from his [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe-lXdRJhyo), and hack through the content myself.
